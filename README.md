# Automated_Sperm_Segmentation_and_DNA-Fragmentation_Index_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning_YOLO-SAM
We propose a deep learning–based framework to automate sperm analysis and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) classification. The pipeline integrates:

YOLOv8 → for robust sperm head detection.

Segment Anything Model (SAM) → for precise segmentation guided by YOLO bounding boxes.

EfficientNet-B0 → for classification of cropped sperm heads into Low DFI and High DFI categories.

This hybrid approach combines task-specific detection with general-purpose segmentation, offering a fast and reliable solution for male infertility diagnostics.
